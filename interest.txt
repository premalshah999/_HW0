Why are you interested in taking DATA602?

Hey everyone, I'm Premal Shah, and I'm pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Maryland at College Park. In my first semester, I took a course called DATA602: "Principles of Data Science" under the professor Dr. Fardina Alam. This course gives a vast introduction to the domain of Data Science, and I chose this course to refresh my skills with Python and libraries that are used for data science. What I like the most about the course is that the syllabus is designed in very layman terms and it provides links to every sub-domain that I can possibly pursue with Data Science, such as Statistics, Big Data, Machine Learning, Data Engineering, Mining, and many more. My main focus while pursuing this course will be on gaining my grip on Python back, while getting ready for the corporate world, and networking with a vast diversity of people from different domains, with whom I can achieve a killer project for my portfolio.
